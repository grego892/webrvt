Web Remote VoiceTrack




As of 6/3/2021 I have the UI mostly setup and a few buttons doing something on JS.

1) First hit the load button.
2) Then hit the "Voice Track" button.  This begins the process of playing the "outro" of the previous song.
3) Press the record button.  This will start recording the audio.
4) Press play "cut 2".  (This will start the next song)
5) Press "stop" to end the process.
6) "play all" will play all of this back in the browser.
