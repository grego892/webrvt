Web Remote VoiceTrack



This is my first practical project using HTML/CSS and Javascript.

It mimics software I use at work but makes it web based.  The app will take a radio station log (playlist including commecials) and make it available for the DJ's to remotely voicetrack.

This means they can hear the end of a song, record thir voice inbetween songs, then fire the next song.  That audio will then be sent to the radio station and will be played inbetween songs.


As of 6/3/2021 I have the UI mostly setup and a few buttons doing something on JS.

1) First hit the "Voice Track" button.  This begins the process of playing the "outro" of the previous song.
2) Press the record button.  This will start recording the audio.
3) Press play "cut 2".  (This will start the next song)
4) Press "stop" to end the process.
5) "play all" will play all of this back in the browser.
